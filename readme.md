# to-do-list

Live at: 

To do list created with HTML CSS and JS. Bundled together with webpack. 
Features localStorage.

What I learned

- building a medium-sized project using modularity
- using localStorage for my data structures to be saved locally
- deepened my knowledge on interacting with the DOM
- I realized how much I want to learn React to automate all the manual adding HTML from JS (lol)
